bio: "Marcin is a proactive IT advisor who combines business and technical expertise with 10+ years of experience in enterprise software sales across sectors, building technical alliances, and supporting channel sales. I focus on open-source solutions and love sharing knowledge by speaking at conferences.
Marcin's vision is for open source to become as sustainable as proprietary solutions—in both product development and revenue growth.
In his free time, he enjoys traveling and outdoor sports (Hiking!). Happy husband and father of a young fellow."
